# passable

A simple no-fuss selfhostable password generator.

Built originally with an easy-to-use lightweight selfhosted password generator in mind.

## Hosted version

Coming soon.

## Features

- Generates random secure passwords
- Basic layout responsiveness
- Copy to clipboard

## Future development

If you wish to contribute and develop any of the following before I do feel free to fork the repo and make a PR.

- More secure passwords
- Adjust password length
- Fully responsive layout
- Nicer layout
- Remove the need for jquery?

## Installation

This shouldn't even be necessary to read if you've hosted a simple php website before.

- Go to the document root of your web server, or the subdirectory/subdomain's folder where you want to host the site from.
- `git clone https://github.com/aaronduce/passable.git`
- From there just start your web server, whether that is nginx, apache or some XAMPP bs. No databases or other configuration necessary.

## Updating passable

- Delete all remnants of the last install.
- Rerun `git clone https://github.com/aaronduce/passable.git`
